    <h1>Services</h1>
    <p>Coaching and therapy services can take many forms. In fact, many different services can be utilized to treat the same issue. And for some problems there is scientific support for different services. For example, depression can be treated with both individual and couples therapy.</p>
    <p>While many are unaware of the role couples therapy can play in the emotional life of an individual, there is scientific support for couples therapy to treat depression. Similarly, anxiety can be treated by both individual therapy and group therapy.</p>

    <h2>Individual Therapy</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I treat people alone. Because they have no one. No one loves them. Individual psychotherapy provides clients with customized strategies to quickly address time- urgent problems. Longer term issues are also addressed with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other appropriate techniques. This approach aims to create long-lasting improvement by teaching clients techniques to manage existing issues as well as to navigate future challenges on their own.</p>

    <h2>Marital Therapy</h2>
    <p>Couples are usually doomed to ruin.  I try to get them there slower. Couples meet with a psychotherapist to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual and how this interaction contributes to relationship problems, as well as the positive aspects of the relationship. A collaborative approach is used to overcome barriers and enhance overall satisfaction with the relationship as well as each individualâ€™s approach to life.</p>

    <h2>Family Therapy</h2>
    <p>Man, family. What can I say about that?  You're just stuck with them. Many problems take place in the home environment or even across households. When family members are willing to use therapy together, this can be a highly effective treatment. Many issues are patterned across generations, have developed from early childhood experiences, and are currently still wreaking havoc in both the family relationships.</p>
